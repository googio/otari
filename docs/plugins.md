# Plugins

A plugin adds a feature to a running Otari without a change to Otari itself:
API routes, `otari` command groups, database tables with their own migrations,
and a page in the dashboard. Otari's first plugin, Agent Gates, checks whether a
coding agent's turn followed a repository's stated rules; it lives in its own
repository and is installed like any other.

A plugin runs inside the gateway process with everything the gateway can reach:
provider credentials, the database, every request. Treat installing one the way
you would treat installing a package into the gateway's environment, because
that is what it is. The dashboard says so before every install, and installing
through the API is off until an operator turns it on in `config.yml`.

## Installing a plugin

Three ways, all ending in the same place: a plugin the gateway discovers at
startup.

**From the dashboard.** The Marketplace page lists plugins mozilla.ai verifies
and plugins anyone has tagged on GitHub with the `otari-plugin` topic. Installing
one downloads the repository archive into the plugins directory. This needs
`plugins.allow_install: true` (or `OTARI_PLUGINS_ALLOW_INSTALL=true`) and a
restart afterwards. The same page uploads a `.zip` or `.tar.gz` you built
yourself.

**From the command line**, on the machine running the gateway:

```bash
otari plugins install njbrake/warden                # a GitHub repository, default branch
otari plugins install njbrake/warden --ref v0.1.0
otari plugins install ./otari-warden.zip             # a local archive
otari plugins list
otari plugins remove agent-gates
```

`install` writes into the plugins directory and needs no `allow_install`
setting: whoever runs it already has the gateway's filesystem. A curl
equivalent of the upload, for a gateway you reach over HTTP, is in
`scripts/upload_plugin.sh`.

**As a Python distribution**, for an image you build yourself:

```bash
uv pip install otari-agent-gates
```

A distribution registers itself through the `otari.plugins` entry-point group,
so nothing else is needed. The dashboard lists it with source `entry_point` and
cannot remove it; `uv pip uninstall` does.

A plugin takes effect on the next start, whichever way it arrived. The
Marketplace page says when a restart is owed.

## Configuration

```yaml
plugins:
  directory: ./otari-plugins     # drop-in plugins; where install and upload write (OTARI_PLUGINS_DIR)
  allow_install: false           # let the API and dashboard install (OTARI_PLUGINS_ALLOW_INSTALL)
  disabled: []                   # discovered plugins to leave unloaded
  marketplace:
    verified_index_url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla-ai/otari-plugins/main/index.json
    github_topic: otari-plugin
    github_token: null           # raises the GitHub search rate limit
  agent-gates:                   # a plugin's own settings, under its name
    ...
```

Everything under `plugins:` that is not one of the four settings above is a
plugin's own block, handed to that plugin as it is. The plugin documents what
it accepts.

Plugins load in every mode. Their migrations run only where the gateway has a
database of its own, which excludes hybrid mode.

## Writing a plugin

A plugin is a Python package holding an `otari-plugin.toml` and a
`register(ctx)` function. The manifest is read before any plugin code runs,
which is how the installer and the marketplace describe a plugin without
importing it.

```
otari-agent-gates/
  pyproject.toml
  src/otari_agent_gates/
    otari-plugin.toml
    __init__.py            # register(ctx)
    routes.py
    cli.py
    models.py              # the plugin's own SQLAlchemy Base
    migrations/            # an Alembic script directory
      env.py
      versions/
    static/                # the built dashboard page, index.html and assets
```

```toml
# src/otari_agent_gates/otari-plugin.toml
[plugin]
name = "agent-gates"              # letters, digits, hyphens; the URL segment the plugin mounts at
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Checks a coding agent's turn against a repository's stated rules."
package = "otari_agent_gates"     # the importable package; the manifest sits inside it
homepage = "https://github.com/mozilla-ai/otari-agent-gates"

[plugin.ui]                       # optional
path = "static"                   # relative to the package directory
label = "Agent gates"             # the sidebar row
```

```python
# src/otari_agent_gates/__init__.py
from pathlib import Path

from gateway.plugins import PluginContext

from .cli import policy
from .routes import router


def register(ctx: PluginContext) -> None:
    settings = ctx.config                       # the plugins.agent-gates block, raw
    ctx.add_router(router)                      # served under /api/v1/plugins/agent-gates
    ctx.add_cli(policy)                         # `otari policy ...`
    ctx.add_migrations(Path(__file__).parent / "migrations")
```

What each contribution means:

- **Routes** mount under `/api/v1/plugins/<name>`, plus the router's own
  prefix. Mounting adds no authentication. Declare it per route the way Otari's
  routers do, with `verify_master_key`, `require_deployment_operator`, or
  `verify_api_key_or_master_key` from `gateway.api.deps`.
- **CLI groups** attach to `otari` at the top level, under the group's own
  name. A name that collides with a built-in command is skipped and logged.
- **Migrations** are an Alembic script directory. The plugin's `env.py` is two
  lines, and the chain stamps `alembic_version_<name>` rather than Otari's
  `alembic_version`, so the two chains never see each other:

  ```python
  from alembic import context

  from gateway.plugins.migrations import run_plugin_env
  from otari_agent_gates.models import Base

  run_plugin_env(context, Base.metadata, "agent-gates")
  ```

  Declare tables on a `Base` of the plugin's own, not on `gateway.models`'s:
  Otari's autogenerate compares its metadata against the database and would
  otherwise propose dropping the plugin's tables. Migrations run after Otari's
  own, on startup when `auto_migrate` is on and from `otari migrate`, so a
  plugin table may reference a core one.
- **A page** is a directory of static files with an `index.html`, served at
  `/plugins/<name>/ui/`. The dashboard shows it in a frame on the same origin,
  so the page calls the plugin's routes with the session cookie and needs no
  token handling of its own. Build it with whatever you like; hash-based
  client-side routing avoids needing server rewrites under the static mount.

  To look like the rest of the dashboard, link the dashboard's own stylesheet
  rather than bundling a theme: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/dashboard.css">`
  serves the current build's CSS, which carries the semantic tokens
  (`--color-surface`, `--color-muted`, and so on), the HeroUI component styles,
  and the self-hosted fonts. Use HeroUI components and the same token names,
  and mirror the theme the dashboard set on its own root element (a
  `data-theme` attribute and a `dark` class), which a same-origin frame can
  read from `window.parent.document.documentElement` and watch with a
  `MutationObserver`. The dashboard frames the page under its own title, so
  the page should not repeat a title or a sidebar of its own.
- **`ctx.container`** is the composition root, for a plugin that needs a port.
  It is `None` when plugins are loaded for the command line alone.

A plugin that raises during import or `register` is listed as failed with its
error, and the gateway boots without it. Otari never fails to start over a
plugin.

For a plugin installed from a directory, the directory holding the package is
put on `sys.path`. A src layout (`src/<package>/`) and a flat layout
(`<package>/`) both work, with or without the one extra directory a GitHub
archive nests everything under.

## Getting listed

Tag the repository with the GitHub topic `otari-plugin` and it appears in the
Marketplace's community list on every gateway, marked unverified. The verified
list is a JSON index mozilla.ai maintains:

```json
{"plugins": [{"name": "agent-gates", "repo": "mozilla-ai/otari-agent-gates", "description": "...", "version": "0.1.0", "ref": "v0.1.0"}]}
```

`ref` pins what an install fetches; without it, the default branch.
